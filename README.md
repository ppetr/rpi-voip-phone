# Raspberry Pi VoIP Phone

_*Disclaimer:* This is not an officially supported Google product._

This project aims to create an installation and configuration script that will
turn a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) computer into
a [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) telephone. As Raspberry Pi
lacks a microphone, the project will focus on using it with a Bluetooth
headsets, or optionally with an external soundcard.

## Contributions and future plans

Once a skeleton of the project becomes available, contributions will be
welcomed! Please see [Code of Conduct](docs/code-of-conduct.md) and
